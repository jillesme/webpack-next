# A basic webpack project

This is the most basic webpack project you will find. It's what I made for my blogpost called [webpack is not as hard as you think](http://jilles.me/webpack-is-not-that-complicated/).


### Installing

Run `npm i && webpack --watch` to install dependencies and run webpack in a watching state. Then start a webserver in /public and you're good to go!
